# wicked.haufe.io Default Authorization Server

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is an implementation of a default OAuth2 Authorization Server for use with wicked.haufe.io. It will only be compatible with wicked 1.0.0 or later, and will be a part of the standard deployment of wicked.

These changes will not be downported to versions prior to wicked.

See [design documentation](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/wicked.haufe.io/tree/next/doc/design-docs).
